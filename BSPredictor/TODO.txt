### TODO ###
- Re-train the model leaving outside 10 proteins to be able to check it afterwards
- Handle all the warnings that appear when training the model: maybe handle them and then
give a summary of the warnings that appeared


### THINGS I HAVE CHANGED FROM THE ORIGINAL PURESNET ###
- train_model.ipynb: did it from scratch, as it was not present in PUResNet,
but I got based / used the functions used in PUResNet for the prediction
- Small changes in the code to update it to the higher versions of the
packages
- Handled the warnings, both in train_model and in predict.py (TODO)
