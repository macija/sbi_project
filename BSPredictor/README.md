## Important notice

To run predictions use predict.py, first install all needed dependencies. Please consult the manual (pdf atached in parent directory). 

Be aware that if the user wants to use the model shown here (this is, the .h5 file) it needs to be downloaded. Since it weights more than 150MB it has been 
stored to github using Git LFS and it is possible that when cloning the repository to your computer it is not downloaded. Be sure that the model has been
downloaded before trying to run any prediction. If it does not download properly just by cloning the repository you can manually download it using your web
browser and place it in the right directory.
