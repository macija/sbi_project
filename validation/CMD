Validating the model.
Changed validate.py to give all dccs and dvos.
Validation .ipynb runs validate.py to do the predictions usign our modle and obtaining all dccs
 and dvos.

Used: input folder with all the copied directores from scPDB for the validation set
output_our where the prediction using validate.py results will be stored
input_fpocket where all proteins used also in the other input are converted to pdb using:

	for i in scPDB/*; do obabel -imol2 ${i}/protein.mol2 -opdb -O input_fpocket/${i:6:10}; done
since fpockets needs a pdb...

the output of pocket lies in the same folder but in subdirectories.

input for puresnet put in folder input_puresnet like this:
for i in scPDB/*; do cp ${i}/protein.mol2 input_puresnet/${i:6:8}.mol2; done
